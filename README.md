## CleanVision

CleanVision is an AI-powered system designed to detect and report waste in real time. Built for cities, campuses, and public spaces, it helps tackle littering by combining smart detection with instant task creation — making cleanliness more efficient, proactive, and data-driven.

## Problem

Maintaining cleanliness in public facilities, campuses, and urban areas is a persistent issue. Traditional monitoring relies heavily on manual inspections or citizen reports, which often leads to delays in identifying and resolving waste-related problems. Spills and litter can go unnoticed for hours, affecting hygiene, public perception, and operational efficiency.

The key challenges include:

 - Real-time detection of garbage or spills in large and busy areas.

 - Manual task assignment that delays cleaning crew response.

 - Lack of integration between monitoring and facility management systems.


These gaps result in inefficient maintenance workflows and poor cleanliness standards in high-footfall areas.

## Solution


CleanVision offers an end-to-end, AI-powered solution to automate waste detection and task assignment. By leveraging CCTV cameras and object detection models, it can:

 - Continuously monitor for garbage and spills in real time.

 - Instantly generate detailed reports with images, location, and timestamps.

 - Automatically assign tasks to cleaning staff through a mobile app.

 - Provide facility managers with a web-based dashboard to track and manage tasks efficiently.
